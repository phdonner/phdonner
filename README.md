## Introduction

Hi. My name is Philip. Here at GitHub I'm phdonner, but on most other platforms I use the signature pdonner. My native language is Swedish, but was born in Tampere, which is a predominantly Finnish city. Therefore most of the school mates had bilingual competence as a gift. That's a good start in learning English, German, French, Spanish, Kiswahili... other languages.

I've been working in English speaking communities, but any unidiomatic use of English will hopefully be excused. If you have time to [write to me](https://github.com/phdonner/phdonner/blob/main/README.md#contact-information), you can be confident that politely expressed language corrections will be most gratefully received.

## The village network cooperative

Right now my primary occupation is development of fiber optic network maintenance systems and tools. I'm doing this on as a more or less full-time voluntary work task for our rural network cooperative: Kuhmon kyläverkko-osuuskunta (formerly Luoteis-Kuhmon kyläverkko-osuuskunta), which mainly operates in the north-western part of Kuhmo municipality. Kuhmo is located at the Russian border right on the latitude which divides Finland into two equally sized parts. 

Please, also study [the cooperative's Smart Rural 27 pages](https://nettinoste.fi/wp/category/smart-rural-27/), in case you would like to have a look at all the preparatory work that we have been doing. The pages are a mix of Finnish and English content, but most often with summaries in both directions. Internationalism and [multilingual methods](https://github.com/phdonner/phdonner/blob/main/markdown.md#multilingual-markdown) are actually vital themes of the site. That is an energy-consuming, but important aspect of our task.

## GitHub and NOSTERIIHI

Currently, the cooperative is preparing a set of smart rural projects. The funding organization, the Finnish Food Authority, wants us to pay careful attention to project design. The preparatory project aims at clarifying the basic concepts of rural smart development work. With a minor budget, it also offers an opportunity of validating project ideas and defining an effective strategy for future projects. The aim is to arrive at coherent set of sub-projects. 

This planning effort is called [NOSTERIIHI](https://github.com/phdonner/NOSTERIIHI) which is described in the repository with the same name.

Right now we have been working in two directions:

* An [introduction to Markdown](https://github.com/phdonner/Markdown/) presents a quick gateway to the World Wide Web editing for rural web publishers
* The outline [MarkdownProduction](https://github.com/phdonner/MarkdownProduction/) presents tasks involved in designing a low-cost editing, rendering and publishing system.
