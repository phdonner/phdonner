## Introduction

Hi. My name is Philip. Here at GitHub I'm phdonner, but on most other platforms I use the signature pdonner. My native language is Swedish, but was born in Tampere, which is a predominantly Finnish city. Therefore most of the school mates had bilingual competence as a gift. That's a good start in learning English, German, French, Spanish, Kiswahili... other languages.

I've been working in English speaking communities, but any unidiomatic use of English will hopefully still be excused. If you have time to [write to me](https://github.com/phdonner/phdonner/blob/main/README.md#contact-information), you can be confident that politely expressed corrections will be most gratefully received.

## The village network cooperative

Right now my primary occupation is development of fiber optic network maintenance systems and tools. I'm doing this on as a more or less full-time voluntary work task for our rural network cooperative: Kuhmon kyläverkko-osuuskunta (formerly Luoteis-Kuhmon kyläverkko-osuuskunta), which mainly operates in the north-western part of Kuhmo municipality. Kuhmo is located at the Russian border right on the latitude which divides Finland into two equally sized parts. 

Currently, the cooperative is preparing a smart rural project. Please study the cooperative's [Smart Rural 27 pages](https://nettinoste.fi/wp/category/smart-rural-27/), in case you would like to have a look at all the preparatory work that we have been doing. The pages are a mix of Finnish and English content, but most often with summaries in both directions. Internationalism and [multilingual methods](https://github.com/phdonner/phdonner/blob/main/markdown.md#multilingual-markdown) are actually vital themes of this site. That is a energy-consuming, but important aspect of our task.
