## Introduction

Hi. At GitHub I'm phdonner, but on most other platforms I use the signature pdonner. My native language is Swedish, but I was born in Tampere which is a predominantly Finnish city. Therefore most of us had bilingual competence as a gift. That's a good start in learning English, German, French, Spanish, Kiswahili... many languages.

I've been working quite a lot in English speaking communities, but unidiomatic use of English will hopefully still be excused. If you have time to [write to me](https://github.com/phdonner/phdonner/blob/main/README.md#contact-information), you can be confident that politely expressed corrections will be most gratefully received.

## The village network cooperative

Right now my primary occupation is development of fiber optic network maintenance systems and tools. I'm doing more or less full-time voluntary work for our rural network cooperative: Luoteis-Kuhmon kyl√§verkko-osuuskunta. The cooperative is preparing a smart rural project. Please study the cooperative's [Smart Rural 27 pages](https://nettinoste.fi/wp/category/smart-rural-27/), in case you would like to have a look at the preparatory work that we have been doing. The pages are a mix of Finnish and English content, but most often with summaries in both directions.

The next subheadings are a list of some of the immediate tasks that we are facing right now.

## Git and GitHub

Here at GitHub I‚Äôm currently trying to discover how Git, GitHub and related open source tools and services could be beneficial in information society construction. This is an experimental site. So please, don't expect that the content would be static somehow. On the contrary: If the structure and the content develops dynamically, then that could be taken as a sign of active and perhaps even productive work.

## Markdown, Powershell, HTML

Our project is based on the assumption that we are experiencing the first phases of an emerging mode of production. In the information society, the major aspects of production are dependent on information technology. We don't want to be spectators of that process, but active agents. Deep understanding and early adoption of the new tools can be an asset in rural, scarcely populated environments.

I would like to collaborate with others willing to contribute in development of PowerShell automation as a way of empowering rural developers. We would like to state an example how bottom-up oriented, open source voluntary collaboration can be a smart concept which wins over passivating, profit-based top-down work. Here I'll start quite modestly by producing a bilingual tutorial on methods of setting up a low-cost computer environment, which enables rural developers to produce HTML pages. This task will be achieved without resorting to commercial services, such as Facebook. Let's see where the project takes us.

## Multilingual Markdown

In line with earlier work, the tutorial will be published at least in English and Finnish. This is not a unique undertaking, but the aim presents a couple of challenges. It is assumed that this problem has already been tackled in the GitHub community. After assessing those solutions, an attempt will be made to define a set of good practices to be used in other aspects of the project. Perhaps we will be able to reproduce the content in other languages, as well.

## Emoji fonts

When I started this README I received a lot of redundant images, which looked like emoji ;) symbols. It would, however, be nice to know where all these decorative characters are coming from: üòï üëî üëó üëã üå± üê∂ üåº üåª. OK, some of them are provided with Microsoft Windows 11 Segoe UI Emoji font and similar projects (cf. [Emoji Objects](https://emojipedia.org/objects), [Open Source OpenMoji](https://openmoji.org/) contains literally thousands of them). 

As you can see: Here at GitHub the emoji characters can be embedded straight into the Markdown source document. For the time being, these fonts aren't apparently portable out of the box. While experimenting with this interesting resource you may discover that the characters aresometimes rendered with colors, and sometimes in black and white. The meaning of some of the mini sized images may be a bit difficult to figure out. Therefore mastering Markdown font sizes matters.

## Contact information

This is how you should be able to reach me: Try pdonner at the cooperative's nettinoste.fi domain. There is a lot of spam among those mails, but I'm reading the messages of that post office once or twice every week.
