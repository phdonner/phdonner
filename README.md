## Git and GitHub

Right now my primary occupation is development of opto fiber network maintenance systems and tools. Here I’m currently learning how to use GitHub and related open source tools and services which could be beneficial in information society construction.

## Powershell, Markdown, HTML

Would like to collaborate with others willing to contribute in development of PowerShell automation as a way of empowering rural developers. Here I'll start by producing a bilingual tutorial on methods of setting up a low-cost computer environment, which enables rural developers to produce HTML pages without resorting to commercial services, such as Facebook.

## Multilingual Markdown

The tutorial will be published at least in English and Finnish, which presents some challenges. It is assumed that this problem has already been tackled in the GitHub community. After assessing the solutions, an attempt will be made to define a set of good practices to be used in other aspects of the project.

## Emoji fonts

When I started this README I received a lot of redundant images, which looked like emoji ;) symbols. It would, however, be nice to know where all these decorative characters are coming from: 😕 👔 👗 👋 🌱 🐶 🌼 🌻. OK, some of them are provided with Microsoft Windows 11 Segoe UI Emoji font and similar projects (cf. [Emoji Objects](https://emojipedia.org/objects), [Open Source OpenMoji](https://openmoji.org/) contains literally thousands of them). But why are the characters sometimes rendered with colors, and sometimes in black and white?
