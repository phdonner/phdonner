Hi, @GitHub I’m phdonner. In most other sites I would use the signature pdonner

---

Right now my primary occupation is development of opto fiber network maintenance systems and tools. Here I’m currently learning how to use GitHub and related open source tools and services which could be beneficial in information society construction.

Would like to collaborate with others willing to contribute in development of PowerShell automation as a way of empowering rural developers. Here I'll start by producing a tutorial on methods of setting up a low-cost computer environment, which enables rural developers to produce HTML pages without resorting to commercial services, such as Facebook.

When I started this README I received a lot of redundant images, which looked like emoji ;) symbols. It would, however, be nice to know where all these decorative characters are coming from: 😕 👔 👗 👋 🌱 🐶 🌼 🌻. OK, some of them are provided with Microsoft Windows 11 Segoe UI Emoji font and similar projects (cf. [Emoji Objects](https://emojipedia.org/objects), [Open Source OpenMoji](https://openmoji.org/) contains literally thousands of them). But why are the characters sometimes rendered with colors, and sometimes in black and white?

How to reach me: Try pdonner at the cooperative's nettinoste.fi domain. There is a lot of spam, but I'm reading those messages once or twice every week.
