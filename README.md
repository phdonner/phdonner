Hi, @GitHub I’m @phdonner. In most other sites I would use the signature pdonner

Right now my primary occupation is development of opto fiber network maintenance systems and tools Here I’m currently learning how to use GitHub and related open source tools as resources which can be used for information society construction.

Would like to collaborate with others willing to contribute in development of PowerShell automation tools as a way of empowering rural developers. Here I will produce a tutorial on methods of setting up a low-cost computer environment enabling rural developers to produce HTML pages without resorting to commercial services like FaceBook.

When I started this README I received a lot of redundant imaages which looked emoji ;) symbols. It would, however, be nice to know where all these decorative characters are coming from: 👋 👀 🌱 💞️ 📫 

It would be interesting to know if there are some more expressive visual characters, as well?

How to reach me: Try pdonner at the cooperative's nettinoste.fi domain. There is a lot of spam, but I'm reading those messages once or twice every week.
