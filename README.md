Hi, here @GitHub I’m @phdonner. In most other sites I would use the signature pdonner

- Right now my primary occupation is development of opto fiber network maintenance systems and tools
- Here I’m currently learning how to use GitHub and related tools as resources for information society construction
- Would like to collaborate with others willing to contribute in development of PowerShell automation as a way of empowering rural developers
- How to reach me: Try pdonner at the cooperative's nettinoste.fi domain. Im reading those messages once or twice every week.

When I started this README I received a lot of redundant emoji ;) imagary. It would, however, be nice to know where all these decorative characters are coming from: 👋 👀 🌱 💞️ 📫 

It would be interesting to know if there are some more expressive ones as well?
