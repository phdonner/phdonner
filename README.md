Hi, @GitHub I’m phdonner. In most other sites I would use the signature pdonner

My native language is Swedish, but I was born in Tampere which is a predominantly Finnish city. Therefore most of us had bilingual competence as a gift. I've been working quite a lot in English speaking communities, but unidiomatic use of English will hopefully still be excused. If you have time to [write to me](https://github.com/phdonner/phdonner/blob/main/README.md#contact-information), you can be confident that politely expressed corrections will be most gratefully received.

Right now my primary occupation is development of opto fiber network maintenance systems and tools. I'm doing more or less full-time voluntary work for a rural network cooperative which is preparing a smart rural project. Please study the cooperative's [Smart Rural 27 pages](https://nettinoste.fi/wp/category/smart-rural-27/), in case you would like to have a look at the preparatory work we have been doing. It is a mix of Finnish and English content with summaries in both directions.

## Git and GitHub

Right now my primary occupation is development of opto fiber network maintenance systems and tools. Here I’m currently learning how to use Git, GitHub and related open source tools and services which could be beneficial in information society construction.

This is an experimental site. So don't expect that the content would be static somehow. On the contrary: If the structure and the content developes dynamically, then that could be taken as a sign of active and perhaps even productive work.

## Markdown, Powershell, HTML

I would like to collaborate with others willing to contribute in development of PowerShell automation as a way of empowering rural developers. Here I'll start by producing a bilingual tutorial on methods of setting up a low-cost computer environment, which enables rural developers to produce HTML pages. This task will be achieved without resorting to commercial services, such as Facebook.

## Multilingual Markdown

The tutorial will be published at least in English and Finnish, which is an aim that presents a couple of challenges. It is assumed that this problem has already been tackled in the GitHub community. After assessing the solutions, an attempt will be made to define a set of good practices to be used in other aspects of the project.

## Emoji fonts

When I started this README I received a lot of redundant images, which looked like emoji ;) symbols. It would, however, be nice to know where all these decorative characters are coming from: 😕 👔 👗 👋 🌱 🐶 🌼 🌻. OK, some of them are provided with Microsoft Windows 11 Segoe UI Emoji font and similar projects (cf. [Emoji Objects](https://emojipedia.org/objects), [Open Source OpenMoji](https://openmoji.org/) contains literally thousands of them). But why are the characters sometimes rendered with colors, and sometimes in black and white?

## Contact information

This is how you should be able to reach me: Try pdonner at the cooperative's nettinoste.fi domain. There is a lot of spam among those mails, but I'm reading the messages of that post office once or twice every week.
